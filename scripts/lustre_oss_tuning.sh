# On the OSS the option readcache_max_filesize controls the maximum size of a file that both the read cache and writethrough cache will try to keep in memory. Files larger than readcache_max_filesize will not be kept in cache for either reads or writes. This was set to 2M on each OSS via the command
#lctl set_param osd-ldiskfs.*.readcache_max_filesize=2M
# We should allow much larger files to be cached.
